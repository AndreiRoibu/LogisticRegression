# Logistic Regression
## Motivation
This collection respresents a set codes aiding my learning / recap of logistic regression, from it's derivation to applications. This repo contains codes for the Basics of Logistics Regression, Solving fr Optimal Weights, Practical Logistic Regression Concerns, Using Checkpoints, Simple Applications and a project which conducts Facial Expression Recognition.

These codes are inspired by a course created by the [Lazy Programmer](https://github.com/lazyprogrammer). More information can be found at these two links:
